Hi, I’m a senior iOS developer who treats engineering and design as entangled forces — distinct, yet exponentially more powerful when superposed.

### 🧠 Core Beliefs
- Simplicity is not the absence of complexity, but the mastery of it.
- A system is only as elegant as its edge cases.
- Aesthetics without logic is noise. Logic without aesthetics is lifeless.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **iOS**: Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, CoreData, UIKit
- **Architecture**: MVVM, Clean Architecture, Dependency Injection
- **Tooling**: Xcode, Git, XCTest, Instruments
- **Other**: REST, WebSockets, Vapor (in progress), Firebase (in progress)

### 🧩 Current Project
**SyncBoard** – a multiplayer chess variant app focused on turn-based strategy, modern UI, and real-time sync logic (REST + WebSocket hybrid).  
Think: playable design system meets deep state orchestration with a never seen before twist that I can only expose once it's public
